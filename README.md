# Node Mentors

Building up the node community through mentoring

_Why would I want a mentor?_

Are you just learning node, or looking to get started? Have you been struggling with something node-related for a while and not sure where to go next? Mentors can help! 

Mentors can be awesome encouragement when learning gets rough. We're knowledgable, nice, and we want to help you steer through the uncharted waters of code and community.

_How is this different than Stack Overflow?_

The idea is to provide more personal, specific support and hopefully develop healthy mentoring relationships rather than just a quick question/answer exchange. We're figuring it out as we go so tell us what's working and what's not by filing an issue on this repo!

_OK so what do I do?_

Three options:

1. File an issue [here on the GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/node-forward/mentors/issues) and explain a problem you're having, some questions you have, etc. Make sure you note things like the language you speak, your location, or anything else you think matters to the mentor who will ultimately respond and begin to work with you.

2. Ask a question on [our Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/node-forward/mentors) --a chat room that uses your GitHub login as your user account. We'll be watching that channel and responding there, hoping to pair up as we find good matches.

3. `<less public method tbd>` coming soon...
